Edit `data/lessons.ts` to add new lessons:

```typescript
{
  id: 'your-lesson-id',
  level: 1, // or 2, 3
  category: 'Your Category',
  items: [
    { italian: 'Italian Text', english: 'English Translation' }
  ],
  quiz: [
    {
      question: 'Italian Question',
      correctAnswer: 'Correct English Answer',
      options: ['Correct', 'Wrong 1', 'Wrong 2', 'Wrong 3']
    }
  ]
}
```

### Styling
- Colors: Edit Tailwind classes in components
- Animations: Modify `app/globals.css` for custom animations
- Theme: Update `tailwind.config.js` for color scheme changes

## 📝 Notes

- **Audio Pronunciation**: Uses browser's Web Speech API (may vary by browser)
- **Progress Storage**: Uses localStorage (clears if browser data is cleared)
- **Static Site**: No API routes needed - fully client-side
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Audio not working
- Check browser compatibility for Web Speech API
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted (if required)
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Progress not saving
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Check browser console for errors
